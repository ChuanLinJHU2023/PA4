MainPDF.pdf provides all the relevant information about the assignment. It is the first file to view.
main.py implements the fate lines and the online signal processor.

TestCase_S1.py is the test case S1, which is also the 1st trace run to show the correctness of our online signal processor using fate line
TestCase_S2.py is the test case S2, which is also the 2nd trace run to show the correctness of our online signal processor using fate line
TestCase_S3.py is the test case S3, which is also the 3rd trace run to show the correctness of our online signal processor using fate line
TestCase_S4.py is the test case S4, which is also the 4th trace run to show the correctness of our online signal processor using fate line
TestCase_S1_Output is the output of TestCase_S1.py , showing the correctness of our online signal processor
TestCase_S2_Output is the output of TestCase_S2.py , showing the correctness of our online signal processor
TestCase_S3_Output is the output of TestCase_S3.py , showing the correctness of our online signal processor
TestCase_S4_Output is the output of TestCase_S4.py , showing the correctness of our online signal processor

TestRun.py is the test run to measure the asymptotic behavior of our online signal processor
TestRun_Output is the output of TestRun.py, measuring the asymptotic behavior of our online signal processor
TestRun_DatasetInput records the input dataset for the test runs to measure the asymptotic behavior of quicksort
TestRun_DatasetOutput records the output dataset for the test runs to measure the asymptotic behavior of quicksort


ComparisonForTestRun.py draws the graph to compare algorithm’s worst-case asymptotic behavior to the achieved asymptotic behavior of the program
ComparisonForTestRun_Output is a graph of ComparisonForTestRun.py, comparing algorithm’s worst-case asymptotic behavior to the achieved asymptotic behavior of the program

The compiler is python 3.11
The IDE is Pycharm
For every py file, the instruction to run it is "python xxx.py", where xxx.py is the name of the file that you want to run.
